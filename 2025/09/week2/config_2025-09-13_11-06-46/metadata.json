    "commit_message": "feat: enhance Docker switching with mutual exclusion and default-off behavior

- Change default Docker provider from 'rancher' to 'none' 
- Add docker_off() function to stop both Docker providers
- Implement mutual exclusion: switching to one provider stops the other
- Add automatic startup of selected provider if not running
- Update docker_status() to show actual running vs configured status
- Change docker_reset() to turn off all providers (new default behavior)
- Update docker_auto_detect() to be non-intrusive (report only, no auto-switch)
- Add 'doff' alias for docker_off function
- Improve PATH cleanup to handle both Docker providers
- Add helpful command hints to status output

This resolves Docker provider conflicts and reduces memory usage by keeping
both providers off unless explicitly needed.",
