```

---

## 🛠️ **Essential Commands to Know**

### **Check System Status**
```bash
# See what modules are loaded
modular_zsh_status
zsh-status                  # Same thing, shorter

# Get detailed system info
environment_info
env-info                   # Shorter alias
```

### **Reload Configuration**
```bash
# Reload everything
zsh-reload

# Reload with detailed output (for debugging)
zsh-verbose
```

### **Get Help**
```bash
# Main help system
zsh_help                   # Overview of everything
help                       # Same thing

# Module-specific help
zsh_help core             # Essential functions
zsh_help docker           # Container tools  
zsh_help spark            # Apache Spark
zsh_help database         # Database tools
```

---

## 🔧 **Customization Made Easy**

### **Add Your Own Settings**
```bash
# Create your personal config (ignored by git)
nano ~/.config/zsh/user.zsh

# Example content:
export MY_CUSTOM_VAR="value"
alias ll="ls -la"
export SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY="4g"

# Reload to apply changes
zsh-reload
```

### **Machine-Specific Settings**
```bash
# For settings specific to this computer
nano ~/.config/zsh/local.zsh

# Example content:
export LOCAL_PATH="/my/special/path"
alias work="cd /Users/myname/work"

# These are also ignored by git
```

---

## 🌍 **Cross-Platform: Works Everywhere**

### **Automatic Platform Detection**
The system automatically detects where it's running:

```bash
# Check your platform
echo $ZSH_PLATFORM        # Shows: macos, linux, unknown
echo $IS_DOCKER           # Shows: true/false
echo $IS_WSL              # Shows: true/false (Windows Subsystem)

# Get full details
environment_info
```

### **Platform-Specific Features**
```bash
# These work on any platform:
platform_open file.txt    # Opens with default app
platform_copy < file.txt  # Copy to system clipboard  
platform_paste > out.txt  # Paste from clipboard
platform_browser google.com  # Open in default browser
```

### **Container/Docker Friendly**
```bash
# Detects container environments automatically
is_container              # Returns true if in Docker/container
container_info           # Shows container details

# Automatically optimizes for containers:
- Reduced memory usage for big data tools
- Minimal system assumptions
- Faster startup in resource-constrained environments
```

---

## 🔐 **Security: No More Passwords in Files**

### **How Credentials Work Now**
The system tries multiple secure methods automatically:

1. **Environment variables** (your existing setup keeps working)
2. **1Password CLI** (if you have `op` command)
3. **macOS Keychain** (on Apple computers)
4. **Interactive prompts** (asks you securely)

### **Check Your Security Setup**
```bash
# See what credential systems are available
credential_backend_status
creds-status              # Shorter version

# Check database security
database_status
db-status                 # Shorter version
```

### **Your Existing Setup Still Works**
```bash
# If you have these environment variables, they still work:
export PGPASSWORD="your_password"      # PostgreSQL
export MYSQL_PWD="your_password"       # MySQL
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD="password"   # Snowflake

# The system uses them automatically - no changes needed!
```

## 🐳 **Docker & Development Tools**

### **Docker Integration** (if Docker installed)
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker_status
dstatus                   # Shorter alias

# Quick development environments  
docker_dev_env python    # Python development container
docker_dev_env node      # Node.js development container

# Container management
docker_cleanup           # Clean up unused containers/images
docker_shell myapp       # Get shell in running container
```

### **IDE Integration** (if JetBrains tools found)
```bash
# Smart project opening
py .                     # Open current directory in PyCharm
idea .                   # Open in IntelliJ IDEA
open_project .           # Auto-detects project type, opens right IDE

# Check IDE status
jetbrains_status
jb-status                # Shorter alias
```

### **Big Data Tools** (if SDKMAN + tools installed)
```bash
# Apache Spark
spark_start              # Start local Spark cluster
spark_status             # Check cluster status
smart_spark_submit my_script.py  # Submit job (auto-detects best mode)

# Hadoop
hadoop_status            # Check Hadoop cluster status
start_hadoop             # Start HDFS and YARN services
```

## 🧪 **Testing Your Setup**

### **Quick Test**
```bash
# Run the built-in test suite
./test-cross-platform.sh

# Should show:
✅ Platform detection working
✅ All modules loading successfully
✅ All functions available
✅ Startup time <2 seconds
```

### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Test core functions
mkcd /tmp/test_dir       # Should create directory and enter it
extract --help           # Should show help for archive extraction
is_online && echo "Connected"  # Should show "Connected" if online

# Test platform detection
echo $ZSH_PLATFORM       # Should show your platform
environment_info         # Should show detailed system info

# Test modules (if tools are installed)
docker_status            # If Docker available
spark_status             # If Spark installed
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)**

### **Problem: "Functions not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Make sure you sourced the config
source ~/.config/zsh/zshrc

# Or reload everything:
zsh-reload
```

### **Problem: "Modules not loading"**
```bash
# Check what's happening:
modular_zsh_status

# Try loading with debug info:
MODULAR_ZSHRC_VERBOSE=true source zshrc

# Check specific module:
echo $CORE_MODULE_LOADED     # Should show "true"
```

### **Problem: "Slow startup"**
```bash
# Check startup time:
time zsh -c 'source ~/.config/zsh/zshrc'

# Enable timing details:
export ZSH_STARTUP_TIMING="true"
source zshrc
```

### **Problem: "Platform not detected correctly"**
```bash
# Check platform detection:
echo $ZSH_PLATFORM          # Should show: macos, linux, unknown
echo $IS_DOCKER             # Should show: true/false

# Get full environment info:
environment_info
```

### **Problem: "Credentials not working"**
```bash
# Check available backends:
credential_backend_status

# Test credential retrieval:
get_credential "test" "user" "PASSWORD"
```

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Speed Up Your Workflow**
```bash
# Use shorter aliases for common commands:
zsh-status               # Instead of modular_zsh_status
env-info                # Instead of environment_info
creds-status            # Instead of credential_backend_status
dstatus                 # Instead of docker_status
```

### **Get Help Quickly**
```bash
# Search for specific functions:
zsh_help search docker      # Find all Docker-related functions
zsh_help search password    # Find all credential functions
zsh_help search spark       # Find all Spark functions
```

### **Data Science Workflow**
```bash
# Quick Python environment switching
py-list                    # See all available environments
py-switch myproject        # Switch to pyenv environment
py-switch uv              # Use UV in current directory

# Create data science projects
ds-init crypto_analysis           # Basic project  
ds-init stock_analysis spark     # With Spark integration
ds-init geo_analysis geo         # With geospatial tools

# Smart Spark execution (your advanced functions!)
smart_spark_submit analysis.py           # Auto-detects best mode
heavy_api_submit big_job.py yarn        # API-intensive workloads
```

### **Customize Per Project**
```bash
# Create project-specific settings:
echo 'export SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY="8g"' > .env-local
echo 'source .env-local' >> ~/.config/zsh/user.zsh
```
