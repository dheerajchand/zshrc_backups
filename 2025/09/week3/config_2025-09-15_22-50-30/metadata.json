    "commit_message": "feat: add comprehensive debugging and maintenance documentation system

- 🚨 Added DEBUGGING_DIRECTIVES.md with mandatory investigation protocol
- 📚 Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common problems & solutions  
- 🔧 Added MAINTENANCE.md with systematic maintenance procedures
- 📖 Updated README.md with troubleshooting section
- 🏗️ Enhanced SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md with debugging guidance
- 📋 Updated DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md with maintenance checklist

Key Features:
- Mandatory 5-step debugging process (INVESTIGATE → BASELINE → TEST → VERIFY → PROCEED)
- Environment-specific rules (uv run vs python3, PATH management)
- Performance monitoring and health checks
- Emergency recovery procedures
- Automated maintenance scripts

This addresses the repeated debugging failures and provides systematic
approaches to prevent PATH explosion and other configuration issues.",
