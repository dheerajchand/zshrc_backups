    "commit_message": "fix: Correct false 'Big Data Ready' claims based on hostile testing

HOSTILE TESTING FINDINGS - CRITICAL CORRECTIONS:
- Change 'Big Data Ready: Verified end-to-end cluster functionality' to 'Big Data Development'  
- Update Spark claims from 'big data processing' to 'development and learning'
- Accurate capability description: Spark 3.5.3 + Hadoop 3.3.6 for local development
- Remove false claims about verified cluster functionality
- Cluster management has known issues (spark_start failures, YARN timeouts)

Based on comprehensive hostile testing that revealed:
‚ùå No actual running cluster or end-to-end verification
‚ùå spark_start() fails due to SDKMAN integration issues  
‚ùå YARN integration has timeout problems
‚úÖ Basic Spark functionality works for development/learning
‚úÖ Local mode processing tested and functional

This implements the mandatory hostile analysis directive properly.
