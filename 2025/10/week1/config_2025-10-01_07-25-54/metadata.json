ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY FAILURES DISCOVERED

Added comprehensive hostile security analysis revealing:

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (60+ total):
- Command injection via eval() abuse in shell-compat.zsh (15+ vectors)
- Credential system command injection (unvalidated input to op/jq)
- PATH injection attacks enabling privilege escalation
- Symlink attack vector via external oh-my-zsh dependency  
- Race condition vulnerabilities in file operations

EXPLOIT VECTORS:
- Remote code execution through get_credential() injection
- Privilege escalation via PATH manipulation
- Supply chain attacks through uncontrolled symlink
- Data exfiltration via shell compatibility layer
- Persistent backdoors via oh-my-zsh external dependency

SYSTEMIC FAILURES:
- Zero input validation across entire codebase
- External dependencies violate security boundaries
- No defense-in-depth architecture
- Compliance violations (OWASP, CIS, NIST, SOX, ISO27001)

FILES ADDED:
- HOSTILE_SECURITY_AUDIT_CRITICAL.md (comprehensive vulnerability analysis)
- EXPLOIT_DEMONSTRATION.zsh (proof-of-concept exploit script)

RECOMMENDATION: IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION OR REJECTION REQUIRED
This represents fundamental security architecture failure requiring complete redesign.",
