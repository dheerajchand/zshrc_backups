    "commit_message": "fix: Resolve Spark cluster startup and YARN timeout issues

TECHNICAL FIXES BASED ON HOSTILE TESTING:
- Fix SDKMAN integration in ensure_spark_available() function
- Add proper SDKMAN initialization and current version detection  
- Fix YARN timeout in yarn_application_list() with 10s timeout
- Improve error handling for missing SPARK_HOME
- Add fallback detection for Spark installations

TESTED FUNCTIONALITY:
âœ… Spark module loads successfully with CRITICAL_FUNCTION_GUARD
âœ… SDKMAN integration works properly (no more cache errors)
âœ… YARN functions timeout gracefully instead of hanging
âœ… Spark status detection works correctly
âœ… Cluster startup logic improved

These fixes address the core technical issues identified in hostile testing 
while maintaining honest documentation about development vs production capabilities.
