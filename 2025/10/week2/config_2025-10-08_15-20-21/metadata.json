The comprehensive security fixes introduced syntax errors that prevent the system from loading.
Need to rollback to a working state and reapply fixes more carefully.

Issues found:
- Quote matching problems in regex patterns
- P10k prompt expansion syntax issues
- Multiple eval/exec validation patterns broken

System is currently non-functional. Committing broken state to preserve work,
then will need systematic repair.",
