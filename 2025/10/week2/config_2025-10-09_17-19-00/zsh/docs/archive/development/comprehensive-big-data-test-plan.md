# Comprehensive Big Data Testing Plan

## Root Cause Analysis Complete ✅

**Problem:** SDKMAN initialization missing from zshrc
**Solution:** Added SDKMAN init to end of zshrc
**Result:** All big data tools now accessible (Java, Spark, Hadoop)

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment Validation ✅
- [x] SDKMAN installation verified
- [x] Java 17.0.15 working
- [x] Spark installed and accessible
- [x] Hadoop installed and accessible
- [x] YARN functions properly organized

### Phase 2: Service Startup Testing
1. **Hadoop Services**
   - Test: `init_hadoop_dirs` (HDFS initialization)
   - Test: `start_hadoop` (NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager)
   - Test: `hadoop_status` (service status verification)

2. **Spark Services**
   - Test: `spark_start` (Master and Worker startup)
   - Test: `spark_status` (cluster status verification)
   - Test: `spark_test_simple` (basic job execution)

3. **YARN Resource Management**
   - Test: `yarn_application_list` (application management)
   - Test: `yarn_cluster_info` (cluster information)

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. **HDFS Operations**
   - File creation: `hdfs dfs -put`
   - File reading: `hdfs dfs -cat`
   - File deletion: `hdfs dfs -rm`

2. **Spark Job Execution**
   - Local mode: Basic Scala/Python jobs
   - YARN mode: Distributed processing
   - Resource allocation verification

3. **Cross-Service Integration**
   - Spark reading from HDFS
   - YARN resource management for Spark jobs
   - Multi-node simulation

### Phase 4: Real-World Workflow Testing
1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Ingest data to HDFS
   - Process with Spark (MapReduce equivalent)
   - Store results back to HDFS

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Start services: `start_hadoop && spark_start`
   - Submit job: `spark-submit`
   - Monitor: `yarn_application_list`
   - Debug: `yarn_logs`
   - Stop services: `stop_hadoop && spark_stop`

### Phase 5: Error Recovery Testing
1. **Service Failures**
   - Kill individual services and test recovery
   - Test graceful shutdown and restart
   - Verify data persistence across restarts

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Memory limits with large datasets
   - Disk space constraints
   - Network partition simulation

## Expected Functionality After Fixes

### Working Functions
- `sdk` commands (all SDKMAN operations)
- `java -version` (OpenJDK 17.0.15)
- `spark-submit --version`
- `hadoop version`
- All ZSH big data functions should now work

### Integration Points
- Spark jobs can use HDFS for storage
- YARN manages Spark job resources
- All services accessible via web UIs:
  - HDFS NameNode: http://localhost:9870
  - YARN ResourceManager: http://localhost:8088
  - Spark Master: http://localhost:8080

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Big Data Stack
- [ ] Hadoop services start successfully
- [ ] HDFS file operations work
- [ ] Spark local mode executes jobs
- [ ] YARN applications can be listed/managed

### Full Production Stack
- [ ] Spark-on-YARN jobs execute
- [ ] Multi-gigabyte dataset processing
- [ ] Web UI accessibility
- [ ] Fault tolerance (service restart recovery)
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration

## Next Steps
1. Run updated battle test with SDKMAN fix
2. Test individual big data functions systematically
3. Create automated big data workflow validation
4. Document working configuration for future reference
